# Traffic-Violation-Accident-Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to analyze patterns in traffic accidents and violations to:
Identify high-risk areas and times
Understand the impact of weather conditions
Suggest actionable recommendations for reducing accidents and improving road safety

**Dataset Used:**
A synthetic dataset simulating real-world accident data including:
Date & time of incidents
City, state
Weather conditions
Visibility
Temperature
Wind speed
Severity level of the accident.

**Key Questions Explored:**
What time of day sees the most accidents?
Which states and cities report higher severity levels?
Do weather conditions influence accident severity?
How does visibility and wind speed correlate with severity?

**Tools & Technologies Used:**
Python (Data analysis & visualization)
Pandas (Data manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (Interactive analysis)
(Optionally) Folium/Plotly for map-based visualizations

**Project Workflow:**
**‚úÖ 1. Data Preprocessing:**
Parsed timestamps to extract date and time
Handled missing values and standardized units
Created new features like hour of the day from Start_Time

**‚úÖ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Bar charts for accident counts by state and city
Histograms of accident time distribution
Scatter plots showing relation between weather and severity
Count plots for weather conditions involved in accidents

**‚úÖ 3. Key Visualizations:**
üî• Top States by Accident Volume
‚è∞ Most Accident-Prone Hours
üåßÔ∏è Weather vs Severity Impact
üìâ Visibility & Wind Speed vs Accident Severity

**‚úÖ 4. Insights:**
Evening rush hours (5‚Äì7 PM) have the highest number of accidents.
States like California and Texas report higher frequencies due to urban congestion.
Low visibility (fog/snow) correlates with increased severity.
Rain and fog are common weather conditions during accidents.
Wind speed is moderately associated with high-severity incidents.

**Outcomes & Recommendations:**
Add more street lighting and signage during evening hours in urban zones.
Deploy traffic alerts in bad weather conditions.
Encourage use of driver assistance systems during low visibility.
Optimize patrol and emergency response scheduling during peak hours.

**Use Cases:**
Urban planning & smart traffic systems
Insurance companies for claim analysis
Government bodies for infrastructure improvements
AI-based traffic surveillance systems

**Future Enhancements:**
Integrate live GPS and weather API data
Use geospatial clustering (e.g., DBSCAN) for hotspot detection
Predict future accidents using time-series forecasting or machine learning
